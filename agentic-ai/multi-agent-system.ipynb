      "\n",
      "*   **iPhone 18 Series Release and Models:** Apple is expected to introduce the iPhone 18 series in September 2026, with a split launch strategy. The iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, iPhone 18 Air, and the new foldable iPhone are anticipated in Fall 2026. The more affordable iPhone 18 and iPhone 18e models may follow in Spring 2027.\n",
      "*   **Foldable iPhone (iPhone Fold):** Apple's first foldable iPhone is rumored to launch in Fall 2026 alongside the iPhone 18 Pro models.\n",
      "    *   It is expected to have a 5.5-inch display when folded and a 7.8-inch display when unfolded, opening in a \"book style.\"\n",
      "    *   Rumors suggest it will feature a \"crease-free\" display due to an advanced hinge system made from an amorphous alloy (metallic glass) that is 2.5 times stronger than titanium.\n",
      "    *   The iPhone Fold might cost around $2,399, potentially making it Apple's most expensive iPhone.\n",
      "    *   It may include a 24-megapixel under-display camera on the inner screen and Touch ID instead of Face ID.\n",
      "    *   The device is rumored to house the largest battery ever in an iPhone, possibly exceeding 5,000 mAh.\n",
      "*   **iPhone 18 Pro Design and Display:**\n",
      "    *   The iPhone 18 Pro models are expected to maintain a similar general design to the iPhone 17 Pro models, with a triple-lens rear camera system.\n",
      "    *   Speculation suggests a smaller Dynamic Island, or potentially a smaller display hole for the front camera, rather than under-display Face ID for the entire lineup.\n",
      "    *   The iPhone 18 Pro Max could be thicker and heavier, potentially becoming the heaviest iPhone to date.\n",
      "    *   A possible semi-transparent back glass and a unified look, moving away from the iPhone 17 Pro's two-tone appearance, are also rumored.\n",
      "    *   New color options such as Coffee, Burgundy Red, and Purple are being tested for the iPhone 18 Pro.\n",
      "*   **iPhone 18 Performance and Hardware:**\n",
      "    *   The iPhone 18 Pro series is anticipated to feature Apple's next-generation A20 chip, built on TSMC's 2-nanometer process, promising improved performance and power efficiency.\n",
      "    *   A new C2 series 5G modem is expected for faster and more reliable connectivity.\n",
      "    *   Analysts predict 12 GB of RAM will be standard across the lineup to support AI-driven features in iOS 27.\n",
      "*   **iPhone 18 Camera Enhancements:**\n",
      "    *   All iPhone 18 models (excluding the 18e) are rumored to upgrade to a 24-megapixel front-facing camera.\n",
      "    *   The standard iPhone 18 may finally receive the 48MP ultrawide camera.\n",
      "    *   The Pro models might also feature a variable aperture lens for enhanced photography.\n",
      "*   **iOS 27:**\n",
      "    *   Apple is expected to introduce iOS 27 in June 2026, with a full launch in September 2026.\n",
      "    *   iOS 27 is rumored to be a \"Snow Leopard-like\" update, focusing on improving underlying performance, quality, and bug fixes rather than major new features.\n",
      "    *   It will also focus on building new interfaces and experiences to accommodate the larger display of the foldable iPhone, potentially introducing iPad-like multitasking options.\n",
      "    *   More Apple Intelligence capabilities are expected to follow in iOS 27, potentially expanding to additional apps and including a \"World Knowledge\" Siri search feature.\n",
      "    *   Refinements to the Liquid Glass design introduced in iOS 26 are also anticipated.\n",
      "*   **Satellite Features:** Apple is reportedly working on several new satellite features for the iPhone, potentially including Apple Maps via satellite, Photos in Messages via satellite, and a Satellite API for third-party apps, possibly introduced as early as 2027.\n",
      "*   **iPhone 17e:** The iPhone 17e is rumored to get a camera upgrade and potentially a fresh design with a Dynamic Island in early 2026.\n",
      "*   **Pricing:** While the base iPhone 17 saw a price increase, other models are expected to maintain similar pricing, with the base iPhone 17 starting at $799.\n",
